# cache_wrangling
An exploration of how to view the MongoDB cache contents and act on what you see

The 'cache' being referred to here is not the query plan cache, but, instead the RAM set aside by the WiredTiger storage engine to cache documents and indexes for faster access. In short, despite the improvements in storage speed over time, RAM is faster than storage.  

The [FAQ MongoDB Diagnostics](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/faq/diagnostics/) goes into some depth about what the cache is, how to view it, and its function to handle the [working set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_set).  Certainly, MongoDB users ought to be cognizant of how work the DBMS is doing to read data blocks into and evict out of the cache.

If a block MongoDB needs is not in RAM (a cache fault), it has to read it from storage. The more your DBMS is doing that, the slower the overall system performance. This situation is also described as having a working set that is larger than real RAM (as opposed to virtual RAM). As the FAQ states, this is not necessarily something to be concerned about. 

However, it is not clear what to do if you find that your system is overly busy in its cache management. One set of mitigations includes ensuring that queries use indexes and the information model is designed optimally. But, it is still possible, even with optimized queries (and other DB ops), that your system is performing slower than expectations because it's overly busy managing its cache.

What steps would need to be taken to determine what databases, collections, and indexes are being swapped in and out of cache the most often? Knowing this would help to direct your efforts to the parts of your information system that need the most attention. It may not be obvious which queries are slow because of cache faults. The performance of even the most optimal queries/DB ops can be affected by the other, most costly operations.

The work in this repo seeks to explain methods and techniques for using cache metrics to solve performance problems.
